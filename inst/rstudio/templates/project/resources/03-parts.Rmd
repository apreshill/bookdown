# Parts

You can add parts to create groups of chapters. This text can be inserted at the top of the .Rmd file containing that part's first chapter.

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}`

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}`

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}`
