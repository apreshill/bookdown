# (PART) Act one {-}

# Part

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. This text can be inserted at the top of the .Rmd file containing that part's first chapter. No text can go between the part and the first-level header that is the chapter title.

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}`

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}`

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}`
