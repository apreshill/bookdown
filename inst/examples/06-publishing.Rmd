# Publishing

As you develop the book, you make the draft book available to the public to get early feedback from readers, e.g., publish it to a website. After you finish writing the book, you need to think about options to formally publish it as either printed copies or e-books.

## RStudio Connect

In theory, you can render the book by yourself and publish the output anywhere you want. For example, you can host the HTML files on your own web server. We have provided a function `publish_book()` in **bookdown** to make it very simple to upload your book to https://bookdown.org, which is a website provided by RStudio to host your books for free.\index{bookdown.org} This website is built on top of ["RStudio Connect",](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)\index{RStudio Connect} an RStudio product that allows you to deploy a variety of R-related applications to a server, including R Markdown documents, Shiny applications, R plots, and so on.

You do not have to know much about RStudio Connect to publish your book to bookdown.org. Basically you sign up at https://bookdown.org/connect/, and the first time you try to run `bookdown::publish_book()`\index{bookdown::publish\_book()}, you will be asked to authorize **bookdown** to publish to your bookdown.org account. In the future, you simply call `publish_book()` again and **bookdown** will no longer ask for anything.

```{r publish-book-usage, eval=FALSE, code=formatR::usage(bookdown::publish_book, output=FALSE)}
```

The only argument of `publish_book()` that you may want to touch is `render`. It determines whether you want to render the book before publishing. If you have run `render_book()` before, you do not need to change this argument, otherwise you may set it to `'local'`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::publish_book(render = 'local')
````

If you have set up your own RStudio Connect server, you can certainly publish the book to that server instead of bookdown.org.

## GitHub Pages {#ghpages}

You can host your book on GitHub\index{GitHub} for free via GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com). The simplest approach is to publish your book as a GitHub Project Page from a `/docs` folder on your `master` branch as described in [GitHub Help](http://bit.ly/2cvloKV), which will then be available at `https://<USER>.github.io/<REPO>`.

Below we provide instructions for how to setup publishing to a GitHub Project Page. We assume that you are starting with a **bookdown** project linked to a remote GitHub repository that you can push/pull to from your local copy.^[If you do not, you may wish to follow a "New project, GitHub first" workflow (See https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html). After creating a new RStudio Project via git clone, you may run this command in your R console to build a simple **bookdown** book to practice with `bookdown:::bookdown_skeleton(getwd())`.]

1. Because the **bookdown** HTML output is a static, standalone website, you'll need to tell GitHub that your website is *not* to be built via Jekyll. Jekyll (http://jekyllrb.com) is a static website builder, which GitHub Pages supports by default. The key is to create a hidden, empty file named `.nojekyll` in your **bookdown** root directory as follows:

    ```bash
    # assume you have initialized the git repository,
    # and are under the directory of the book repository now
    
    # create a hidden file .nojekyll
    touch .nojekyll
    ```

    If you are on Windows, you may not have the `touch` command, and you can create the file in R using `file.create('.nojekyll')`. If you are using RStudio version 1.2 or higher, you can stage and commit this file using the RStudio GUI. 

1. Open the configuration file `_bookdown.yml`, set the output directory of your book to be `/docs` by adding the line `output_dir: "docs"`, and save this file.

1. Build your book locally, and push all your changes to GitHub (including the `.nojekyll` file). 

1. After you push these files, go to the repository site at `https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO>` and confirm that you see a `/docs` folder and a `.nojekyll` file. Click on the repository's settings and under "GitHub Pages" and change the "Source" to be "master branch `/docs` folder": 

![Screenshot of selecting master branch `/docs` folder for GitHub Pages](images/ghpages-masterdocs.png)

After you have set up GIT, the rest of the work can be automated via a script (Shell, R, or Makefile, depending on your preference). Basically, you compile the book to HTML locally, then run git commands to push the files to GitHub. However, this approach assumes that:

1. You would like to store the rendered book (i.e., the `/docs` folder) on GitHub in your master branch.
1. You are satisfied using a project domain name like `https://<USER>.github.io/<REPO>`.

Although this is a straight-forward approach to publishing your book, it can be very handy to automate the publishing process completely on the cloud, so once it is set up correctly, all you have to do next is write the book and push the Rmd source files to GitHub, and your book will always be automatically built and published from the server side. To do this, you will want to utilize Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org)\index{Travis CI} to build the book in the cloud.

## Travis + GitHub Pages {#travis-ghpages}

Once you have gotten to the stage where your book files are **stored** in the cloud on GitHub, there are a few additional steps involved to have your book also **built** and **deployed** in the cloud with every push to GitHub. The good news is that you only need to do these steps once; after that, building and deploying your site in the cloud is as easy as with the [previous approach](#ghpages): every time you push to your master branch, this will trigger a new book build in Travis, which will in turn trigger a fresh deploy to your GitHub Pages site.

One benefit to this approach compared to the [previous approach](#ghpages) is that your master branch on GitHub will no longer store the rendered book files (i.e., the folders `_book` and `_bookdown_files`). Instead, those files will be present in a separate branch: the `gh-pages` branch. This means that your master branch will contain only the source files, and your `gh-pages` branch will contain only the files from your `_book` folder. 

Another benefit to this approach is that you are able to make changes to your book source files without needing to locally render the book. This may be useful both when collaborating with yourself or with other people. In case you are not familiar with Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org)\index{Travis CI}, it is a service to continuously check your software in a virtual machine whenever you push changes to GitHub. It is a free service for public repositories on GitHub, and was designed for continuous integration (CI) of software packages. Travis CI can be connected to GitHub in the sense that whenever you push to GitHub, Travis can be triggered to run certain commands/scripts on the latest version of your repository.^[You need to authorize the Travis CI service for your repository on GitHub first. See https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/ for how to get started with Travis CI.] These commands are specified in a YAML file named `.travis.yml` in the root directory of your repository, and they are usually for the purpose of testing software, but in fact they are quite open-ended, meaning that you can run arbitrary commands on a Travis (virtual) machine. That means you can certainly run your own scripts to build your book on Travis. Note that Travis only supports Ubuntu and Mac OS X at the moment, so you should have some basic knowledge about Linux/Unix commands. 

Below are instructions for how to setup this publishing pipeline. We assume that you are starting with a **bookdown** project linked to a remote GitHub repository that you can push/pull to from your local copy.^[If you do not, you may wish to follow a "New project, GitHub first" workflow (See https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html). After creating a new RStudio Project via git clone, you may run this command in your R console to build a simple **bookdown** book to practice with `bookdown:::bookdown_skeleton(getwd())`.]

1. You need to instruct Travis to build your book from the source files in a GitHub repository. Since this Travis service is primarily for checking R packages, you will need a (fake) `DESCRIPTION` file as if the book repository were an R package. You may use the command line to enter `touch DESCRIPTION` (or in R: `file.create('DESCRIPTION')`). The only thing in this file that really matters for a **bookdown** project is the specification of dependencies. All dependencies will be installed via the **devtools** package. If a dependency is on CRAN or BioConductor, you can simply list it in the `Imports` field of the `DESCRIPTION` file. If it is on GitHub, you may use the `Remotes` field to list its repository name. Below is an example:

    ```dcf
    Package: placeholder
    Type: Book
    Title: Does not matter.
    Version: 0.0.1
    Imports: bookdown, ggplot2
    Remotes: rstudio/bookdown
    ```

1. In addition to the `DESCRIPTION`, you also need to tell Travis how to build the book in a new file called `.travis.yml`. You can create this file in the terminal with:

    ```bash
    # create the file
    touch .travis.yml
    ```

    If you are on Windows, you can create the file in R using `file.create('.travis.yml')`. We'll provide a complete example of a `.travis.yml` file here, then walk through each of the sections step-by-step below:

      ```yaml
      language: R
      cache: packages
      pandoc_version: 2.3.1
      
      script:
      - Rscript -e 'bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")'
      
      deploy:
        provider: pages
        local_dir: _book
        skip_cleanup: true
        github-token: $GITHUB_PAT  # Set in the settings page 
        on:
          branch: master
      ```

    This file tells Travis CI what to do. The `language` key tells Travis to use a virtual machine that has R installed. The `script` tells Travis how to build the book; `deploy` gives Travis instructions for deploying the book. 
    
    If you use the [container-based infrastructure](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/workers/container-based-infrastructure/) on Travis, you can enable caching by using `sudo: false` in `.travis.yml`. Normally you should cache at least two types of directories: the figure directory (e.g., `_main_files`) and the cache directory (e.g., `_main_cache`). These directory names may also be different if you have specified the **knitr** chunk options `fig.path` and `cache.path`, but I'd strongly recommend you not to change these options. The figure and cache directories are stored under the `_bookdown_files` directory of the book root directory. A `.travis.yml` file that has enabled caching of **knitr** figure and cache directories may have additional configurations `sudo` and `cache` like this:

    ```yaml
    language: R
    pandoc_version: 2.3.1
    sudo: false
    
    cache:
      packages: yes
      directories:
        - _bookdown_files
    ...
    ```

    If your book is very time-consuming to build, you may use the above configurations on Travis to save time. Note that `packages: yes` means the R packages installed on Travis are also cached.

1. The next question is, how to publish the book built on Travis back to GitHub Pages? The Travis documentation shows how to deploy a site to GitHub Pages after a successful build: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/. You will need to grant Travis write access to your GitHub repository by providing a personal access token (PAT), and set the deployment provider details in `.travis.yml`. Here are a few steps you may follow:

    + First, create a [personal access token](http://bit.ly/2cEBYWB) for your account on GitHub with the `public_repo` or `repo` scope (`repo` is required for private repositories). You can view your PATs at https://github.com/settings/tokens. Be sure to copy the token to your clipboard; you may also wish to leave this browser window open while you navigate to Travis just in case. 
    
    + Next, go to `https://travis-ci.org/<USER>/<REPO>/settings` and save this as an "Environment variable", where `NAME` is anything you want it to be (we use `GITHUB_PAT` here as a placeholder only), and `VALUE` is where you paste the PAT from GitHub. You can leave the toggle button to right as is- this will keep your PAT private and will not show the value in your public build log. Click "Add". If you know how to install and use the [Travis command-line tool](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables#defining-encrypted-variables-in-travisyml), you may instead encrypt it in the environment variable `GITHUB_PAT` via command line `travis encrypt` and store it in `.travis.yml`, e.g `travis encrypt GITHUB_PAT=TOKEN`. 
    
    + From your local **bookdown** project files, **add** the following section to your `.travis.yml` (see below for an example full `.travis.yml` file):
      ```
      deploy:
        provider: pages
        local_dir: _book
        skip_cleanup: true
        github-token: $GITHUB_PAT  # Set in the settings page of your repository
        on:
          branch: master
      ```
    The option `on` specifies that the deployment will only occur when the master branch is built. The `local_dir` option is the publish directory, which should be `_book` (unless you changed your `output_dir` in your `_bookdown.yml` file). Although not shown here, there is also a `target-branch` option, which specifies the branch where Travis should push the contents in the `local_dir` to, defaults to the `gh-pages` branch. Note that you do not need to create the `gh-pages` branch first- if one does not exist, Travis will create it on your first push.
    
    + You may wish to backup your local copies of the `_book` (unless you have modified your `output_dir` in your `_bookdown.yml` file) first, but you can now safely delete and ignore both of these folders- these will now be built by Travis. You will still be able to build and preview your book locally, but those folders will no longer appear on your master branch in your remote GitHub repository. If your book was created as part of an R Project, your updated `.gitignore` would then look like this:

      ```
      .Rproj.user
      .Rhistory
      .RData
      .Ruserdata
      _book
      _bookdown_files
      ```
    
    + Once you have your `DESCRIPTION`, `.travis.yml`, and `.gitignore` files ready, commit and push your changes to GitHub. This will trigger a new build on Travis; you should be able to watch your book's build progress on `https://travis-ci.org/<USER>/<REPO>`. A successful build will end with log entries like:
    
      ```bash
      The command "Rscript -e 'bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")'" exited with 0.
      
      Preparing deploy
      Deploying application
      Done. Your build exited with 0.
      ```

With this setup working, you *can* separate your build and deploy scripts, rather than keeping them within a single `.travis.yml` file. With more complicated book builds, this may be preferred, and has the added benefit of allowing you to customize the commit message from Travis to your `gh-pages` branch. To start, you would edit your `.travis.yml` as follows:

```yaml
language: R
cache: packages
pandoc_version: 2.3.1

before_script:
  - chmod +x ./_build.sh
  - chmod +x ./_deploy.sh

script:
  - ./_build.sh
  - ./_deploy.sh
```

Next, create two new Shell scripts in the `master` branch named `_build.sh` and `_deploy.sh`. An example `_build.sh` script could look like:

```bash
Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')"
Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')"
Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::epub_book')"
```

And an example `_deploy.sh` script could look like:

```bash
# clone the repository to the book-out directory
git clone -b gh-pages https://${GITHUB_PAT}@github.com/${TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG}.git book-out
cd book-out
cp -r ../_book/* ./
git add --all *
git commit -m "Update the book" || true
git push -q origin gh-pages
```

Note that in the above script the only thing you might need to change is `GITHUB_PAT` with the **name** you gave to your Travis Environment Variable that stores your GitHub personal access token- this name could have been anything. `TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG` is a defined variable for Travis.

If you would like even more customization of commit messages, you can add one more line to `.travis.yml` in the `before_script` section as follows (keep all other YAML elements as before):

```
before_script:
  - export DEPLOY_MSG="${TRAVIS_COMMIT:0:7} ${TRAVIS_COMMIT_MESSAGE:0:70}"
```

Then in your `_deploy.sh` file, you can **edit** the `git commit -m "Update the book" || true` line, replacing the generic commit message `"Update the book"` with `"$DEPLOY_MSG"`. With these changes, the commit messages in your `gh-pages` branch will be meaningful: you can see the shorthand commit ID and your commit message, and you can click on either to view the relevant commit history. All above scripts and configurations can be found in the `bookdown-demo` repository: https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo/.

GitHub and Travis CI are certainly not the only choices to build and publish your book. You are free to store and publish the book on your own server.

## Publishers

Besides publishing your book online, you can certainly consider publishing it with a publisher\index{publisher}. For example, this book was published with Chapman & Hall/CRC, and there is also a free online version at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ (with an agreement with the publisher). Another option that you can consider is self-publishing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-publishing) if you do not want to work with an established publisher. Pablo Casas has written two blog posts that you may find useful: ["How to self-publish a book"](https://blog.datascienceheroes.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book/) and ["How to self-publish a book: customizing bookdown"](https://blog.datascienceheroes.com/how-to-self-publish-a-book-customizing-bookdown/).

It will be much easier to publish a book written with **bookdown** if the publisher you choose supports LaTeX.\index{LaTeX} For example, Chapman & Hall provides a LaTeX class named `krantz.cls`, and Springer provides `svmono.cls`. To apply these LaTeX classes to your PDF book, set `documentclass` in the YAML metadata of `index.Rmd` to the class filename (without the extension `.cls`).

The LaTeX class is the most important setting in the YAML metadata. It controls the overall style of the PDF book. There are often other settings you want to tweak, and we will show some details about this book below.

The YAML metadata of this book contains these settings:

```yaml
documentclass: krantz
lot: yes
lof: yes
fontsize: 12pt
monofont: "Source Code Pro"
monofontoptions: "Scale=0.7"
```

The field `lot: yes` means we want the List of Tables, and similarly, `lof` means List of Figures. The base font size is `12pt`, and we used [Source Code Pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-code-pro) as the monospaced (fixed-width) font, which is applied to all program code in this book.

In the LaTeX preamble (Section \@ref(yaml-options)), we have a few more settings. First, we set the main font\index{font} to be [Alegreya](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/alegreya), and since this font does not have the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small Capitals</span> feature, we used the Alegreya SC font.

```latex
\setmainfont[
  UprightFeatures={SmallCapsFont=AlegreyaSC-Regular}
]{Alegreya}
```

The following commands make floating environments\index{floating environment} less likely to float by allowing them to occupy larger fractions of pages without floating.

```latex
\renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.05}
\renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.8}
\renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.8}
\renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.75}
```

Since `krantz.cls` provided an environment `VF` for quotes, we redefine the standard `quote` environment to `VF`. You can see its style in Section \@ref(markdown-syntax).

```latex
\renewenvironment{quote}{\begin{VF}}{\end{VF}}
```

Then we redefine hyperlinks to be footnotes, because when the book is printed on paper, readers are not able to click on links in text. Footnotes will tell them what the actual links are.

```latex
\let\oldhref\href
\renewcommand{\href}[2]{#2\footnote{\url{#1}}}
```

We also have some settings for the `bookdown::pdf_book` format in `_output.yml`\index{\_output.yml}:

```yaml
bookdown::pdf_book:
  includes:
    in_header: latex/preamble.tex
    before_body: latex/before_body.tex
    after_body: latex/after_body.tex
  keep_tex: yes
  dev: "cairo_pdf"
  latex_engine: xelatex
  citation_package: natbib
  template: null
  pandoc_args: --top-level-division=chapter
  toc_unnumbered: no
  toc_appendix: yes
  quote_footer: ["\\VA{", "}{}"]
  highlight_bw: yes
```

All preamble settings we mentioned above are in the file `latex/preamble.tex`, where we also specified that the front matter starts:

```latex
\frontmatter
```
In `latex/before_body.tex`, we inserted a few blank pages required by the publisher and wrote the dedication page.
Before the first chapter of the book, we inserted

```latex
\mainmatter
```

so that LaTeX knows to change the page numbering style from Roman numerals (for the front matter) to Arabic numerals (for the book body).

We printed the index in `latex/after_body.tex` (Section \@ref(latex-index)).

The graphical device (`dev`) for saving plots was set to `cairo_pdf` so that the fonts are embedded in plots, since the default device `pdf` does not embed fonts. Your copyeditor is likely to require you to embed all fonts used in the PDF, so that the book can be printed exactly as it looks, otherwise certain fonts may be substituted and the typeface can be unpredictable.

The `quote_footer` field was to make sure the quote footers were right-aligned: the LaTeX command `\VA{}` was provided by `krantz.cls` to include the quote footer.

The `highlight_bw` option was set to true so that the colors in syntax highlighted code blocks were converted to grayscale, since this book will be printed in black-and-white.

The book was compiled to PDF through `xelatex` to make it easier for us to use custom fonts.

All above settings except the `VF` environment and the `\VA{}` command can be applied to any other LaTeX document classes.

In case you want to work with Chapman & Hall as well, you may start with the copy of `krantz.cls` in our repository (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/tree/master/inst/examples) instead of the copy you get from your editor. We have worked with the LaTeX help desk to fix quite a few issues with this LaTeX class, so hopefully it will work well for your book if you use **bookdown**.
